# pricingpanel

A quick pricing panel code-along from my Udemy course. This project is based off of a codepen by Travis Williamson. This project was very fun to code along with as it showed great examples of styling, flexbox, and media queries. These elements together helped build a responsive website looks great on both desktop and mobile.
